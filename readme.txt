installation instructions:
The client side was done with React technology, the server side was done with Node, the data was saved with moongoDB
For the CSS library I used bootstrap, 
additions to the project
product deletion button,
The add-on doesn't work perfectly.. due to the lack of time, but anyway I decided to upload it like this... and put it in a comment

The installation instructions are the same for the server and the client,
Two stages:
1. npm i
2. npm start
Thanks for the trust and good luck with the test!
